        options: ["Accept null hypothesis", "Reject null hypothesis", "No relationship", "Equal means"],
        correct: 1,
        explanation: "A low p-value (<0.05) suggests strong evidence against the null hypothesis."

        options: ["Non-linear relation", "Average difference", "Joint variability of two variables", "Causation"],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Covariance shows whether two variables move together."

    {
        q: "10. The correlation coefficient (r) ranges between:",
        options: ["-1 and 1", "0 and 1", "-∞ and ∞", "0 and ∞"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "r ranges from -1 (negative correlation) to +1 (positive correlation)."

        q: "11. Which of these distributions is symmetric?",
        options: ["Normal", "Exponential", "Chi-square", "Poisson"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "The Normal distribution is symmetric about its mean."

        options: ["Poisson variable", "Binomial variable", "Bernoulli variable", "Uniform variable"],
        correct: 2,
        explanation: "Bernoulli variables represent single-trial binary outcomes (success/failure)."

    {
        q: "13. What is the mean of a standard normal distribution?",
        options: ["0", "1", "Depends on data", "Undefined"],
        correct: 0,
        explanation: "Standard normal distribution has mean = 0 and standard deviation = 1."
